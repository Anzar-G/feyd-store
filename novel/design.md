# Design Specification

## Visual Identity

- The design philosophy is 'Sacred Literature,' treating each novel not just as a product but as a vessel of profound stories and Islamic values. The aesthetic is inspired by the editorial design of 'Kinfolk' magazine and the minimalist, material-focused approach of 'Aesop' branding. The style is intentionally quiet, respectful, and deeply human, creating a space for contemplation and connection. It avoids religious clichés, instead opting for a universal and sophisticated visual language that speaks to the soul. The entire experience feels like browsing a curated, independent bookstore.

- The visual narrative evokes the feeling of a quiet, sun-drenched afternoon spent reading in a serene library. The atmosphere is one of peace, warmth, and intellectual depth. Light and shadow are used subtly to create a tactile, almost physical connection to the books. The focus is on texture, natural materials, and a sense of timelessness. The goal is to make the user feel they are discovering a rare, precious object, not just a book.
